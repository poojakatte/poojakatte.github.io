<h3>Run the Messier Marathon</h3>

<p>It's time for the annual Messier Marathon. Instead of lacing up their Nikes, amateur 
astronomers will be hauling telescopes, star charts, and a hefty pot of coffee in an all-night 
vigil hunting the Messier objects.</p>


<p>Messier objects (such as M42-The Great Orion Nebula shown at right) are stellar objects, 
	classified by astronomer Charles Messier in the 18th century, ranging from distant galaxies 
	to star clusters to stellar nebula. March is the only month in the year in which all 110 
	Messier objects are in the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see all of them, you have to 
	start looking right after sunset and continue until just before sunrise, hence 
	the term, "marathon."</p>

<p>Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects. He made the list in order 
	to avoid seeing them. Messier was more interested in discovering new comets and these beautiful 
	stellar objects were often mistaken for comets before Messier made his list.</p>
